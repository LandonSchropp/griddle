# Griddle

Griddle is a beautiful, simple, responsive, powerful grid system built using flexbox. It allows a developer to create dynamic, pages quickly and easily.

For a look at what Griddle can do, check out the demos on CodePen. TODO: Add CodePen demos.

## Getting Started

Griddle is open source because my my benevolent employer, Quve, allowed me to share it. If you're a developer based in the Seattle area and you're interested in building awesome things like Griddle, [drop me a line](mailto:landon@quve.com).
