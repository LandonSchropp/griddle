# Griddle

Griddle is a beautiful, simple, responsive, powerful grid system built using flexbox. It allows a developer to create dynamic, pages quickly and easily. Griddle works in every modern browser, including IE10+.

To see Griddle in action, check out the demos on CodePen.

TODO: Add CodePen demos.

## Using Griddle with Sass

* Download Griddle and include it in your project.
* Add Autoprefixer to your project.
* Set the Sass variables
* Use the mixins or classes included in Griddle.

To start, either download the Sass file and include it in your project or source the project from CDNJS. TODO: Add the project to cdnjs.

## Using Griddle with Vanilla CSS

TODO: Fill out this section.

* Either download the Griddle file or include using the CDN by adding `<script src="..."></script>` to your project.
* Use the build in classes.

## Usage

TODO: Add a section on how to use the grid system.

## Gotchas

There are a few minor caveats to be aware of when using Griddle:

* Due to the way flexbox works, the gutter cannot be applied directly to a column or row element.
Instead, it's applied to each of the child elements of the row and column.
* The gutter is always on the left and right sizes of the elements.
