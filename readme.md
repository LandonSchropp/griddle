# Griddle

Griddle is a beautiful, simple, responsive, powerful grid system built using flexbox. It allows a developer to create dynamic, pages quickly and easily. Griddle works in every modern browser, including IE10+.

To see Griddle in action, check out the demos on CodePen.

## Gotchas

There are a few minor caveats to be aware of when using Griddle:

* Due to the way flexbox works, the gutter cannot be applied directly to a column or row element.
Instead, it's applied to each of the child elements of the `row` and `column`.
* The gutter is always on the left and right sides of a `row` or `column`.
